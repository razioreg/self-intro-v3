# self-intro-v3

Good morning dear teachers, it's such a pleasure for me to bring you my self-introduction.

A wide range of interests have been shaped and cultivated during the many years I have grown up. I love music,espechially piano solo of rewrited cosmic covers, and popular English singles. In fect, I myself have started practising piano at a younger age, but let's say, I personally appritiate enjoyment more than achievement in instruments. Also, I found myself very interested in computer science, in which field did I learn the concept of open-source and community contribution.
